# Advent of Code

How far will I get this year?

## How to run it

Use `jest` to run the code

- `yarn test` - runs all puzzles
- `yarn test --watch` - runs any puzzles that have changed since the last commit

## input.txt

The AoC creators ask us not to commit our inputs, so to run any solutions from 5th Dec 2024 you'll need to create a valid `input.txt` file in the folder. If you don't have an input, you can just copy the `example.txt` file and rename it to `input.txt`.
