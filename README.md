# Advent of Code

How far will I get this year?

I do cheat a bit and manually convert the input into valid JS/JSON. I feel that
the challenges aren't testing my ability to read a raw text file every day.

## How to run it

You can either use `node` or `jest`

- `node ./2021/02/puzzle` - runs all of the puzzles for day 2
- `jest --watch -t 02` - runs all of the puzzles and tests for day 2
- `jest --watch -t 02a` - runs the first puzzle and test for day 2
- `jest --watch -t 02b` - runs the first puzzle and test for day 2
