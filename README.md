# Advent of Code

How far will I get this year?

I do cheat a bit and manually convert the input into valid JS/JSON. I feel that
the challenges aren't testing my ability to read a raw text file every day.

## How to run it

You can either use `node` or `jest`

- `node ./2021/02` - runs all of the puzzles for day 2
- `yarn test --watch` - runs any puzzles that have changed since the last commit
